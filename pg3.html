        <h2>Life experiences Relating to this Advocacy / How this advocacy came to be / Background information</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 50px;"> When I was around 2 years old, my doctors diagnosed me with ASD. At first, my parents were understandably surprised and worried, thinking I might not progress well in life because of this condition. Instead of enrolling me in a SPED school, they decided to send me to a regular school. From Grades 1 to 3, I struggled a lot with socializing and often had to attend therapy sessions after class.
        <br><br>
        Thankfully, my teachers noticed my strengths in academics and encouraged me to focus on my talents. With their support, my parents also urged me to join team sports like soccer to help me improve my social skills and build friendships. Over time, I realized that life is not just about academics—it’s also about connecting with others and learning how to belong.
        Today, I no longer need therapy, but I still see many people like me being left out of friend groups because they are seen as “different” or “weird.”. That is why this advocacy is so important to me. I want to help minimize the inequalities between persons with disabilities (PWDs) and others, and to build a community where inclusion, understanding, and acceptance truly matter</p>
