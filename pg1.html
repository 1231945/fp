                    <h2>What is ASD?</h2>

                        <p>In short, ASD or Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition is a neurological condition that affects normal  
                         brain development.  individuals that have this usually have difficulties with social interaction, communication, or have
                         repetitive things that they do
                            (mannerisms or activities). The symptoms appear in early childhood. They also have fixations on
                            certain things and are  sensitive/insensitive to sensory inputs like loud noises and pain, respectively.

                    <h2>How to treat/interact with people with ASD?</h2>

                        <p>Now, there is no cure for ASD, so "treating" them just aims to give the person a better quality of life (Ex. They can now interact with other people easily.).
                            Some interventions include behavioral, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. The best course of action is to do early intervention, as in 
                            give the child therapy as early as possible, since their brain is still developing.

                                 <p><em>Some tips when interacting with people with ASD</em> <br>
                                     When interacting with individuals with ASD, keep note of the following things:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Be direct and say what you mean. Try to not use figures of speech or sarcasm, since it may confuse them.</li>
                            <li>If you give them instructions, make sure they are in a clear sequence. Afterward, make them repeat your instruction to ensure that they actually understand</li>
                            <li>Use visual aids when needed, since people with ASD are usually visual learners.</li>
                            <li>Respect their boundaries (especially with eye contact). From personal experience, prolonged eye contact still sometimes
                                 makes me uncomfortable. So when interacting with them, try to not force them to make eye contact with you.
                            </li>
                            <li>Use their interests to build a good relationship with them. (Lucky you if both of you have the same interests!)   </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>The spectrum of ASD and how to recognize people with it</h2>

                        <p>The spectrum of ASD is very wide, however there are 3 main levels as to how much care they need.
                            They are:<br>
                            1: Requiring support socially, but can live rather normally <br>
                            2: Requiring more support socially, symptoms more severe, and its markers are very obvious.<br>
                            3: Requiring a lot of support and help in communication,also needs daily assistance.<br>
                            Most, if not all individuals have difficulties when socializing, adapting to new environments
                             ,and their interests are usually very restricted, refraining them from trying new things. They are also
                             either very or less sensitive to some sensory inputs like touch.<br>
                             However, when it comes to intelligence, it is a different story.
                             Some individuals may be intellectually disabled (below average), average, and some being
                             above average or even talented in some areas like music or math.<br>
                            The things mentioned above may also help you recognize/identify
                            people with ASD.<br>
                            <h3>How to recognize individuals with ASD from infancy-toddlerhood?</h3>
                             <p>Recognizing individuals at their early stages of life is very important,
                                since it helps parents give them early intervention.<br>
                                Here are some warning signs (mostly visible by 2-3 years old):
                             </p>
                            <ol>
                            <li>They have little to no eye contact</li>
                            <li>They rarely respond to their name/smile</li>
                            <li>They consistently don't respond to their name (Note:It can be suspected for hearing loss)</li>
                            <li>They don't try to imitate another person's actions like clapping/waving</li>
                            <li>They show a dislike for change </li>
                            <li>They don't usually show emotion</li>
                            <li>They have a weird reaction to sensory inputs, like being very disturbed by loud noises</li>
                            <li>They may be disruptive/aggressive/passive when socializing with others</li>
                         </ol>
                         <p>I recommend parents to read the book: The Out-of-Sync Child Has Fun by Carol Stock Kranowitz, M.A</p>
