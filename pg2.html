                    <h2>Why I chose this advocacy ?</h2>

                        <p>I chose this advocacy, since as someone who was diagnosed with ASD, I can understand how other people with this condition 
                            see the world. I also noticed that many people with this condition are usually
                            discriminated against, and not involved in friend groups, because many people see them
                            as weird, and also because the lack of social skills of the individual with asd. Therefore, I made this advocacy
                            to provide opportunities for individuals with ASD to socialize and get help. Not only that,
                            This advocacy of mine aims to also spread awareness about this condition to possibly encourage 
                            parents that may be shocked because of their child's condition.

                    <h2>More statistics (global) relating to ASD</h2>

                        <p>Since ASD is a rather common condition, with even the WHO stating that 1 in 100 people have it, here are
                            some more statistics about it:</p>
                         
                        <ul>
                            <li>Around 61.8 million people are estimated to have ASD.</li>
                            <li>The diagnosis ratio between males and females is 3.8:1</li>
                            <li>The standardized prevalence of males is 1065/100,000 individuals , while the prevalence for
                                females is only at 508/100,000 individuals.
                            </li>
                            <li>70-96% of ASD individuals may have co-occurring conditions like ADHD</li>
                            <li>Around 1/3 of children with ASD have an accompanying intellectual disability</li>
        
                        </ul>

                    <h2>A personal statement related the Background Problem: What ASD truly is</h2>

                        <p>ASD is not a condition with a fixed set of symptoms. It is a spectrum with a 
                        wide variety of individuals. While most individuals have many core things in common, like being
                        awkward socially, or hypo- or hypersensitive to sensory input, no two people with ASD have the exact same set of symptoms. 
                       For example, two individuals may differ in intelligence:
                        one individual may have high intelligence, while the other might only have average intelligence. <br>
                        Another example would be the differences in their needs:
                        one individual may live independently, while the other may need constant supervision from someone else.<br>
                        While these individuals may appear different from the ordinary person, they are not "disabled" or "broken". 
                        They simply perceive and feel the world differently, and that's what makes them unique. So, instead of trying to discriminate against them, we 
                        should try to understand them more, accept them for who they are, and try to make a better environment for them to live in.
                        <b><em>ASD may be considered a disability by many; however, because it is a spectrum, I consider it to be a different "ability"
                        </em></b>.
                        <h3><b>A letter to Parents: (Credits to My Mom)</b></h3>
                        <b><em>"I understand that having children with ASD is overwhelming, but please remember that it is not the end. There is hope, growth
                            and so much potential ahead with early intervention and support. You have to believe that in their own time they can thrive in beautiful ways. 
                        They may connect themselves differently, but it doesn't make them less. With patience, 
                        understanding and love your child can flourish in ways that will surprise and inspire you.
                         While they may be different from other children, they can still possibly live well and have good friends."
